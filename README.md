# GymWebApp - Mock-Up Gym Web Application üèãüèº - [Webstie](https://gymwebapp-reactjs.netlify.app)

GymWebApp is a mock-up gym web application created using ReactJS. It showcases a visually appealing design with a range of features that simulate a real gym website. The app includes a captivating hero section, comprehensive program listings, a "Why Us" section highlighting the unique aspects of the gym, plans and pricing details, and a testimonials section to showcase client feedback.

With its sleek styling and intuitive user interface, GymWebApp offers a glimpse into a modern and engaging gym website. It serves as a demonstration of my frontend development skills and showcases my ability to create visually appealing and interactive web applications using ReactJS.

Please note that this project is a mock-up and intended for portfolio purposes to exhibit my design and development skills.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
